# Shintsha

Just like the internet is the gateway to information, we believe Shintsha could be the gateway to cryptocurrencies in the African context.  Cryptocurrencies are massively gaining traction but accessing them proves to be quite a challenge due to the knowledge and peripheral requirements. So “WE” as the Shintsha team are trying to change this for the African context by removing these barriers and building on top of already existing infrastructure like SMS, WhatsApp, USSD and mobile money services such as M-Pesa, Orange Money, FNB E-Wallet, Shoprite Money Transfer, etc.

Our initial solution from the on set was a broader vision where we envisioned a decentralized online market for farmers but we found out that this wouldn’t be possible without building existing infrastructures that enables faster and easier access to crypto via already familiar and existing infrastructures, we have gone ahead to build APIs on these infrastructures which can be leveraged on to build more decentralized solutions for the African ecosystem.

> **Shintsha** meaning Exchange in the isiZulu language is a set of APIs that leverages existing infrastructures such as WhatsApp to send and receive crypto in Africa.

Our aim is to increase the adoption of crypto and promote financial inclusion in Africa.

Users can simply add the Shintsha number on their cellphone and send a prompt, they will, in turn, be guided on how to register, send and receive crypto all while using Whatsapp. 

The team made up of 4persons from Africa, were the Overall Winners of the **Road to Devcon Open Finance Bounty**. Since then, we have gone ahead to optimize our solution based on intensive research.
